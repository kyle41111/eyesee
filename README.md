# eyesee
Eyesee Visualizes Web pages based on fuzzed directories with the help of feroxbuster and eyewitness. Perfect for quick reporting, or reference checks.
This is the start of a bigger plan of mine. This will run along side a project of mine that was inspire by AutoRecon. Except, it fits my methodology more closely.
There are two shorter term goals i have for this project.

1.Feed Eyesee results to burpsuite to populate scope correctly.

2.Direct Data streams to cherry tree nodes for easy reporting. 


Usage:

bash eyesee.sh 
ip: google.com
https or http: https
port: 8080 (or leave empty)
